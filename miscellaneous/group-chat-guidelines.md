To ensure a respectful and enjoyable experience for all members, please adhere to the following rules and guidelines:

**1. Respect and Kindness:** Treat every member with respect and kindness. Harassment, hate speech, bullying, or any form of disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.

**2. Appropriate Content:** While you are free to discuss various topics, please refrain from posting or sharing any explicit or pornographic content, or anything considered Not Safe for Work (NSFW). This group is meant to be a safe space for all members.

**3. Privacy Matters:** Please do not share, leak, or screenshot private conversations or arguments that occur within the group. What happens in the group should stay within the group.

**4. No Personal Attacks:** Disagreements and debates are natural, but personal attacks or insults are not allowed. Keep discussions civil and focused on the topic at hand.

**5. Stay on Topic:** Try to keep your conversations relevant to the group's purpose or subject matter. If you wish to discuss unrelated topics, consider creating a separate chat for that purpose.

**6. Confidential Information:** Do not share sensitive or confidential information about yourself or others unless you have explicit permission to do so.

**7. No Spam:** Avoid excessive self-promotion, spamming, or flooding the chat with repetitive messages. This includes sharing links or advertisements unrelated to the group's interests.

* This encompasses instances where the **'@everyone'** feature is employed to notify the entire class without a valid reason.

**8. Inclusive Environment:** Be mindful of creating an inclusive environment for all members. Avoid inside jokes or references that might exclude others.

**9. Report Concerns:** If you come across any violations of these rules or witness any inappropriate behavior, please report it to the group admin or any class officers privately.

**10. Private Conversations:** If you wish to engage in a private conversation with someone from the group, please respect their privacy and seek their consent before initiating the conversation.

> These rules will be applicable to all group chats, including those created for other courses' group chats.
