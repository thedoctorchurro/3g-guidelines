# Study-Aid Repository Guidelines

Introducing the _**Study Aid Repository**_: A Valuable Resource for Academic Success

The Study Aid Repository is an innovative platform designed to foster collaborative learning and support students in their academic endeavors. It serves as a centralized hub for a wide range of study materials, class notes, and helpful resources, all of which are contributed and shared by students, for students. This dynamic and interactive approach enhances learning opportunities and promotes a sense of community within educational institutions.

We have established a dedicated Discord category within our class server for the project, where you can access all files and documents related to school or courses.

Make sure to be in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vkpen4tuhf) so you can have accessed to files given from our classmates.

**Rules:**

* Only members with access are allowed to post in the designated channels to prevent message congestion.
