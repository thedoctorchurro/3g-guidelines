# Peer Recognition Qualifications

We propose the implementation of a Peer Recognition Awards program designed to celebrate and acknowledge exceptional students who consistently demonstrate outstanding qualities in academics, leadership, and their positive impact on the class. This initiative aims to provide a comprehensive and meaningful system of recognition for our fellow classmates, fostering a culture of appreciation and encouragement within our academic community.

***

**Selection Process:**

The Peer Recognition Awards will utilize a fair and transparent selection process. Classmates will have the opportunity to nominate their peers who exemplify excellence in any of the specified categories or will be announced by the Class Officers. A dedicated committee, comprised of both students and the class officers, will then evaluate the nominations and determine the recipients based on clearly defined criteria.

***

**Award Presentation:**

Winners of the Peer Recognition Awards will be honored in a Discord Channel in our server and within the Class Announcement Group Chat, providing a platform to publicly acknowledge their contributions. Each awardee will receive a certificate and, where feasible, additional tokens of appreciation to commemorate their achievements.

We believe that the introduction of the Peer Recognition Awards will not only celebrate our individual and collective achievements but also strengthen the bonds within our class. It is an opportunity for us to show appreciation for the outstanding qualities that make our class exceptional and to inspire continued growth and excellence.
