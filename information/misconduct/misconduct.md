# Misconduct

As a brief cautionary note, it's essential to understand that as a member of the class officers, you are not exempt from adhering to the rules and regulations. You are expected to serve as a role model and set a positive example for others. Any misuse of your position to exert inappropriate authority may result in your removal or expulsion from the team.

It is imperative that you strictly abide by the rules, as violations will be subject to equivalent consequences. Just like any other student, if you witness any fellow class officers breaching the College of Nursing and/or the University Handbook, you are empowered to address their actions and point out their negative influence on the class.

Should you encounter any issues with a fellow class officer, don't hesitate to report them to the Vice Presidents or the President. Ensure you provide substantial evidence, and appropriate actions will be taken regarding their behavior.
