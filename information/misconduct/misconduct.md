# Misconduct

It is imperative that you strictly abide by the rules, as violations will be subject to equivalent consequences. Just like any other student, if you witness any class officers breaching the College of Nursing and/or the University Handbook, you are empowered to address their actions and point out their negative influence on the class.

Should you encounter any issues with other classmates, don't hesitate to report them to the Vice Presidents or the President, or any of the Class Officers. Ensure you provide substantial evidence, and appropriate actions will be taken regarding their behavior.
