# 3-Strike Policy

Strikes remain in effect indefinitely once they are issued and must be addressed promptly.

For those who are part of the miscellaneous team, there is a possibility of being summoned for a conference at the discretion of any Vice Presidents, President, or the Class Adviser. This action may be taken in the event of a severe violation that raises concerns about the violator's fitness to continue their duties or hold their position within the class officers.

{% tab title="Warning" %}
Before issuing a first strike, the class officer handling the reported complaint will first attempt to address the issue through education. This approach aims to enhance the knowledge and understanding of the student in question, seeking a positive outcome for all parties involved. However, if the reported complaint is deemed to warrant a more substantial response than a mere warning, the Vice President or the President retains the authority to initiate a progression of punitive actions, beginning with the issuance of a first strike.

{% tab title="1st Strike" %}
This shall be recorded as an official warning, and the student in question will undergo a thorough and impartial inquiry by a member of the class officers, conducted in a highly professional manner.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2nd Strike" %}
Upon receiving a second strike within the class, you will be required to attend a conference with the Class Adviser or at the discretion of the Class President or any designated reviewer. During this conference, your privileges and responsibilities within the class will be temporarily suspended, and you will not be permitted to engage in any of them.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3rd Strike" %}
Upon receiving a third and final strike, you will be obligated to attend a conference immediately. This conference will involve the Level Chairperson, the Dean, your parents/guardians, and the Class Adviser. The timing of this conference may vary depending on the severity of the violation. It's important to note that this final punitive action necessitates the additional approval of the Class Adviser.
