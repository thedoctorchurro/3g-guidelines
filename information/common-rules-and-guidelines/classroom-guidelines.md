# Classroom Guidelines

**Classroom Rules & Guidelines**

* Please be considerate of other classrooms that may be concurrently hosting classes, and exercise mindfulness regarding the volume of your conversations with classmates within our classroom premises. Demonstrating respect for the academic environments of other students and ensuring minimal disruption through maintaining an appropriate noise level during discussions is a fundamental expectation we must uphold.
  * This directive extends to any unwarranted disturbances originating from within our class during _**lectures**_. It is incumbent upon the class officers to fulfill their role in maintaining a conducive learning environment by promptly addressing instances of disruptive behavior. If any student is observed engaging in disruptive conversation, they should be politely reminded to maintain a quieter demeanor, in alignment with our commitment to fostering a respectful and focused learning atmosphere.
  * It is recommended that we refrain from employing the _**'shhh'**_ gesture or sound when a fellow student has already taken the initiative to remind the class to lower their voices. Instead, we should actively support and reinforce the reminder provided by our peers, thereby contributing to a more harmonious and cooperative classroom environment.
  * During _**laboratory classes**_, it is crucial to bear in mind that the repercussions for misconduct or violations are more substantial and stringent compared to those in lecture sessions. Therefore, it is imperative that we exercise heightened mindfulness and discipline. We must not emulate the conduct of other sections that may not uphold the same standards of maintaining a respectful and quiet demeanor during laboratory sessions.
* The principle of 'Your trash, your responsibilities' underscores the importance of individual accountability. Even though we have designated Officers-of-the-Day, it should not lead to a dependence on them to clean up after you. Each one of us is responsible for disposing of our own trash appropriately.
* In situations where the current class instructor provides instructions and a fellow student appears to be inattentive, we kindly request that you take the initiative to inform them in a polite and considerate manner.
