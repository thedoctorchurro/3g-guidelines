# Campus Guidelines

**School Canteen**

* We kindly request that you exercise mindfulness when occupying seats at the school cafeteria/canteen. If your intention is solely to engage in casual conversations with friends and not to consume a meal, we encourage you to vacate the tables and seating areas designated for students who will be dining. This ensures that all students have access to appropriate seating during meal times.
* We also strongly encourage everyone to adhere to the 'Clean-As-You-Go' (CLAYGO) policy after finishing your meals, even if others may not follow suit. Taking personal responsibility for cleaning up after ourselves not only contributes to a more pleasant dining environment but also demonstrates our commitment to cleanliness and orderliness in shared spaces.

**Staircase**

* In accordance with the guidance from our College of Nursing Dean, we strongly advise all students to refrain from loitering and sitting on the school staircases. This measure is essential to maintain the safety and unobstructed passage of students.
* Adhere to the **"Keep Right"** protocol when ascending or descending staircases to mitigate the risk of congestion within the passageway.
