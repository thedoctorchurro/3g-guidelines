# OD Guidelines

**Officers of the Day Guidelines**

* We have established a mechanism to address accountability. Failure to fulfill daily duties during the designated term will result in sanctions administered by the Class Officers.
* A daily notification will be dispatched via the group chat to communicate the individuals responsible for the day's duties.
* Recognizing exemplary performance, we have introduced a commendation system. Colleagues have the opportunity to commend a fellow member within their group for outstanding commitment and effort. As an incentive, the Class Officers will present rewards to those who receive such recognition.

**Duties and Responsibilities**

* You have already received the master list that designates your respective teams or groups. It is important to note that the responsibility for knowing your assigned group does not rest with the class officers; it is incumbent upon each student to familiarize themselves with this information.
* Regular role pings or notifications will be dispatched daily through our Officers-of-the-Day dedicated channels within our Discord Server. If you have not joined the server yet, kindly request an invitation to ensure you receive these notifications periodically.
* _**Medical-Surgical Nursing & Nursing Research:**_
  * Mr. Amit will periodically share tasks, assignments, and related information on our Nursing Bulletin Board, conveniently located on the 5th Floor near the Nursing Faculty. It is your responsibility to capture photographs of these announcements and ensure they are promptly relayed to the entire class.
  * The necessity to capture photographs of announcements remains unchanged, irrespective of whether the day aligns with the scheduled subjects. This responsibility is an integral part of your duties and must be consistently upheld.
  * Prior to Mr. Amit's scheduled class period, it is expected that the designated Officers-of-the-Day (ODs) will convene at the Nursing Faculty Office fifteen (15) minutes in advance to await instructions from the respective instructor. These instructions may encompass tasks such as preparing and transporting the necessary materials and equipment, including but not limited to speakers and DLP equipment, to be utilized during the lecture.
* The guidelines and expectations outlined in the preceding message are applicable not only to the mentioned course but also extend to all other courses scheduled for the current semester.
* Prior to the commencement of classes and upon their conclusion, the Officers-of-the-Day hold the responsibility of maintaining classroom cleanliness and ensuring the proper arrangement of chairs. It is imperative that following the dismissal of each class, the Officers-of-the-Day remain present as the final group to exit the classroom, thereby guaranteeing its tidiness and orderliness.
* The Officers-of-the-Day are entrusted with handling matters that may arise between class instructors' instructions during the intervals between classes.

> It is not incumbent upon us to continuously remind individuals of their assigned groups. However, it is imperative to emphasize that failing to fulfill daily responsibilities may result in sanctions and could warrant a conference referral.
