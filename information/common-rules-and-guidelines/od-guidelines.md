# OD Guidelines

**Officers of the Day Guidelines**

* We have established a mechanism to address accountability. Failure to fulfill daily duties during the designated term will result in sanctions administered by the Class Officers.
* A fixed assigned date for the officers-of-the-day has been established to avoid confusion and miscommunication of the assigned group per day.
* ~~Recognizing exemplary performance, we have introduced a commendation system. Colleagues have the opportunity to commend a fellow member within their group for outstanding commitment and effort. As an incentive, the Class Officers will present rewards to those who receive such recognition.~~
  * _This has been on hold._

**Duties and Responsibilities**

* You have already received the master list that designates your respective teams or groups. It is important to note that the responsibility for knowing your assigned group does not rest with the class officers; it is incumbent upon each student to familiarize themselves with this information.

**Per-Courses/Subject Duties and Responsibilities:**

* _**For STS 101 and ENTREP 100:**_
  * Designated Officer of the Day (OD) personnel are required to coordinate with one of the Class Public Relations staff members regarding any necessary communication with the instructor if they intend to meet the class a day before the scheduled session. This coordination should take place one day in advance of the scheduled class.
* _**Psychiatric Nursing (NCM 117):**_

  * After dismissal, the Officer of the Days (OD) must remain the final individual to exit the classroom. They are tasked with ensuring the room is left in a tidy and orderly state.

* The guidelines and expectations outlined in the preceding message apply not only to the mentioned course but also extend to all other courses scheduled for the current semester.
* Before the commencement of classes and upon their conclusion, the Officers-of-the-Day hold the responsibility of maintaining classroom cleanliness and ensuring the proper arrangement of chairs. It is imperative that following the dismissal of each class, the Officers-of-the-Day remain present as the final group to exit the classroom, thereby guaranteeing its tidiness and orderliness.
* The Officers-of-the-Day are entrusted with handling matters that may arise between class instructors' instructions during the intervals between classes.
