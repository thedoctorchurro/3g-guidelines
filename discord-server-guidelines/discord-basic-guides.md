## What is a Server?

Discord gives you the power to create an **invite-only** home for your friends or community - a place where you can talk, hang out, and have fun. We call these special places - **servers**, and they look like this:

* You can join or create servers for all kinds of communities -- be it a book club 📚, a dance class 💃 , a study group 🖊️, or just some friends you want to spend time with. &#x20;

## How to use Text and Voice Channels

Your server is made up of **text channels** and **voice channels**.&#x20;

* **Text Channels**

**Text channels** are separate spaces for talking over text. They keep conversations organized and give everyone plenty of room to talk. Create separate channels for all the topics your group likes to talk about--from fishing trips to cooking tips.&#x20;

* **Voice Channels**

**Voice channels** are where you can hang out over voice and video. There’s no calling or ringing required - just click on a voice channel to enter it. Friends in your server can see you’re in there, and pop in to talk, wave hello over video, or share their screen.&#x20;
